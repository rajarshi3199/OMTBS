# SmartBridge Externship Programme - Modern Application Development using Java Spring Boot

This repository contains the assignments and group project developed by the participants of the SmartBridge Externship Programme on Modern Application Development using Java Spring Boot. The program focused on building practical skills in developing web applications using the Spring Boot framework.

## Group Project: Movie Ticket Booking System

The group project in this repository is a Movie Ticket Booking System developed using Java Spring Boot API. It provides a web-based interface for users to browse available movies, select showtimes, and book tickets online. The system allows users to register, log in, and make secure payments for their bookings. The project showcases the knowledge and skills gained during the externship programme.

## Assignments

The repository also contains individual assignments completed by the group members. Each assignment focuses on a specific aspect of Java Spring Boot development. The assignments cover topics such as CRUD operations, RESTful APIs, database integration, authentication and authorization, and more. Each assignment is implemented as a separate module within the repository.
